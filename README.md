## Details
Application Name: Jio

Description: Mobile application to streamline and facilitate group ordering of supper from restaurants

Platforms: IOS, Android

Powered by: ReactNative, Firebase

Developed by:  Ivan Ho Weng Kwong & Cheong Chin Meng Boston

## Problem Statement
There is a lack of a hassle-free solution to order and deliver food to NUS for large groups of people. Currently, students make use of ‘manual’ collation methods such as adding on to a list via messenger apps which is confusing and easy to mess up. Students also face problems keeping track of payment for the meals when the number of orders become too large. Lastly, students also miss out on joining a ‘jio’ when they are not informed that it was happening.

 

## Idea
- A Mobile Application that allows students that stay on campus to organise, keep track and manage meal arrangements efficiently, reliably and effortlessly.

## Features
- Authentication
- Create Account
- Lobby System
- Create Room System
- Room System
- Menu
- Room History
- Tracking of Payment System
- Notification System

## Usage
- Android currently has bug with FCM
- Web Config for firebase placed in src/config.js
- FCM file for iOS place in ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
